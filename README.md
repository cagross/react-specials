This app displays the weekly specials in the meat/deli department, for one specific grocery store (with more to come).

This is a passion project of mine, built with ReactJS (for now).  It is by no means complete, or even that useful in its current version.  See the [To Do section](#todo) below for future plans.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Eating frugally is a goal for many people.  For those that cook at home, a good strategy is to wait for your favorite food items to go on sale at a local grocery store, then stock up on those items.  But how do you know when your favorite items are on sale?  The only way is to visit the store's website and look through the [weekly circular](https://circular.giantfood.com/flyers/giantfood?type=2&show_shopping_list_integration=1&postal_code=22204&use_requested_domain=true&store_code=0774&is_store_selection=true&auto_flyer=&sort_by=#!/flyers/giantfood-weekly?flyer_run_id=406535) for your favorite item--which may or may not be present--then repeat the process for <i>all other</i> area stores.  This is quite tedious.  The objective of this app is to help alleviate this by:

* Combining the weekly specials for mutliple stores into a single list, which is easily searchable and easily sortable.
* Automatically emailing you when your favorite items go on sale for below a threshold price.  For example, you'll receive an email whenever ribeye steaks go on sale for less than $5.00/lb.

## üíª Installation <a name = "installation"></a>
This section will eventually help get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. It is currently devoid of those instructions, only because I have not yet had time to add them.  If you are interested in contributing, send me a message via GitHub and I would be happy to add instructions to this section.

<!-- ### Prerequisites

<!-- ### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo. -->

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Currently, opening the app in a browser displays the meat/deli items currently on sale for one specific Giant Food grocery store (in Arlington, VA, USA).  The app displays an image of the item, a description, the sale price, and if possible, the current unit price of the item.  The app allows you to filter results by type (beef, chicken, or pork).  But the filtering is not yet perfect--you may observe some inconsistencies.  

## üìã To Do <a name="todo"></a>
* Increase the number of stores searched by the app.
* Add more store search functionality (e.g. search all stores within a given radius).
* Improve the filtering logic.
* Display specials for other grocery store departments.
* Automatically email results to registered users.  e.g. email notification when PRODUCT A is on sale for less than $X per pound.
* Ensure app is fully responsive.
