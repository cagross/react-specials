This app displays the weekly specials for the meat/deli department, for one specific grocery store (with more to come).

This is a passion project of mine, built with ReactJS (for now).  It is a work in-progress, and is by no means complete.  See the [To Do section](#todo) below.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Eating frugally is a goal for many people.  For those that cook at home, a good strategy is to wait for your favorite food items to go on sale at a local grocery store, then stock up on those items.  But how do you know when your favorite items are on sale?  The only way is to visit the store's website and look through the weekly circular for your favorite item--which may or may not be present--then repeat the process for <i>all other</i> area stores.  This is quite tedious.  The objective of this app is to help alleviate this by:

* Combining the weekly specials for mutliple stores into a single list, which is easily searchable and easily sortable.
* Automatically emailing you when your favorite items go on sale for below a threshold price.  For example, you'll receive an email whenever ribeye steaks go on sale for less than $5.00/lb.
