This app displays the weekly specials for the meat/deli department, for one specific grocery store.

This is a passion project of mine, built with ReactJS (for now).  It is a work in-progress, and is by no means complete.  See the [To Do section](#todo) below.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
